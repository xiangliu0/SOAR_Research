# SOAR Research Poster
"Maping the U.S. Weather: Climate Forecasting with Deep Learning" 
My Research Poster completed in the SUNY Summer Opportunity For Academic Research(SOAR) Program Summer 2024. 

I worked on using Deep Learning models known as [Neural Operators]([url](https://zongyi-li.github.io/neural-operator/)) to predict the temperature of the United States up to >=24 hours. Data is grabbed from the [ERA5 Dataset]([url](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels)). 

Data processing is done using Pandas and Numpy. Xarray is used for visualizing and converting data


The program is funded by the [SUNY Research Foundation]([url](https://www.rfsuny.org/)).
